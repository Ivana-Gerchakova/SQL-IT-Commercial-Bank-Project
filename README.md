Departments: Successfully inserted 10 different departments manually, establishing an effective categorization system for employees based on their roles and responsibilities.

Employee Data: Accomplished the import of comprehensive employee information from the WideWorldImporters database. Ensured a balanced distribution of employees across seniority levels and departments, enhancing the overall organizational structure.

Salary Data Generation: Developed and executed SQL scripts for the generation of salary data spanning the past 20 years (01.2001 to 12.2020).
